1.  Introduction

   Media over QUIC is an IETF WG and its output of set of specifications
   that is inteded to be useable to address a couple of use cases
   realted to low latency media delivery.  This document provides a high
   level overview of how these components relates to each other and what
   is needed for a specific use case to define an interoperable media
   delivery solution.

   The protocol work

1.1.  Use Cases

   The development of the MoQ components considerd the following use
   cases and what their main requirements.  However, this may not
   prevent the MoQ protocol components to be used for other use cases
   than what is listed here.

   In general the goal of the solution is enable ease of dynaimc scaling
   of number of participanting endpoints and distributed cloud
   deployments.  The solution only assumes existance of unicast IP
   transport between involved nodes.

1.1.1.  Live Streaming Media Delivery

1.1.2.  Real-time Conferencing

1.1.3.  Content Contribution

2.  Media Over QUIC overview

   Meida over QUIC consists of several different components that allows
   to build various different applications.  Below we provide an
   overview of these components after having discussed the involved type
   of nodes.

2.1.  Data Model

2.2.  Nodes

   Consumer: An endpoint that want to consume (receive) one or more
   tracks from one or more track namespaces.

   Publisher: An endpoint that can send a consumer one or more tracks
   for a given track namespace.

   Original Publisher: The endpoint is the originator of one or more
   tracks for a particular track namespace.

   Relay: An endpoint that is both a consumer and a publisher, but not
   an orignal publisher.  Thus acting as relay between the orignal
   publisher and a consumer endpoint.  Relays can also use another relay
   as publisher to enable scaling of the publisher nodes, as well as to
   handle geographical distribution of receivers to optimize
   performance.

2.3.  Media Over QUIC Transport

   Media over QUIC Transprot (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport] is the
   protocol which is used between a publisher and a consumer.  The
   protocol supports a couple of different capabilities:

   Subscribe: Request the publisher to forward media objects of a meida
   track as they are created or received from upstream publisher.

   Fetch: Request the publisher to provide a specific range of media
   objects for a track that the publisher has previously received and
   cached.

   Announce: A publisher announces a track namespace which is available
   for subscribe and fetch to the consumer.

   When the consumer is subscribed to a track the publisher will try
   forward all media objects of the track scheduling the transmission
   according to priorities on the different objects competing for
   available transport bitrates across all tracks the consumer is
   subscribed to.

   MOQT uses either QUIC [RFC9000] or WebTransport
   [I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview] to transport its messages and media
   objects.  These transport protocols also are used to provide hop-by-
   hop confidentiality and integrity.

   MOQT is dependent on that there exists method for authorization and
   authentication of the consumer and publisher to ensure that they have
   the right to either access a track or publish a track in this track
   namespace.  This mechanism has not yet been defined.

   The media objects related to a track are delivered over either
   independent streams or using unrelaible datagrams depending on what
   best suits the media and application when it comes to latency and
   reliability.

   Note: Add something about what happens when there are insufficinet
   bandwidth.

2.4.  Catalog

   The catalog is a media track description format that enables the
   application to understand what track names exists in a track
   namespace.  The catalog describe for each track the track's
   properties like peak bitrate, encoding format, relation to other
   tracks for lip synch etc.

   A catalog is not necessary for all applications, as the application
   may have a fixed track name structure with known encodings and
   properties.

   The WARP streaming format [I-D.law-moq-warpstreamingformat] defines
   one catalog format that is specific for WARP.  However, it is
   expected that it can be the basis for other formats and be extended
   for other applications.  However, it is up to the application
   specifications to define which catalog format they use.

2.5.  Media Formats

   The media objects are opaque blobs from the perspective of MOQT.
   However, the application need to decode these and thus they need to
   be in a format supported by the consumer and its application.
   Therefore, the application will need to define which media formats
   that are required to be supported.

   The MoQ WG is currently expected to define at least one media format,
   namely the Low Overhead Media Container [I-D.mzanaty-moq-loc].  This
   is a format that targets minimal overhead around the media objects as
   defined by the WebCodecs browser API.

   As CMAF have been dominant for a long time in general streaming
   applications there has expessed some interest in defining a MoQ media
   format using CMAF but currently no such proposal exists.

2.6.  End-to-End Object Security

   MOQT provides only hop-by-hop confidenitality and integrity
   protection.  It has been expected that some applications want
   stronger security properties, like end-to-end confidentiality as well
   as source authentication.  To meet these goals there exists a
   proposal for such a mechanism.  [I-D.jennings-moq-secure-objects]
   proposes that each media object's payload is encapsualted in an
   SFRAME [RFC9605].

   Keying and cipher negotiation is currently application specific.

2.7.  Application Interopability

   One or more application sharing the same needs for how Media over
   QUIC operates can define a interoperaiblity point.  An
   interoperability point is defining which components and their
   versions that is need to be supported to be interoperable.

   The WARP Streaming Format [I-D.law-moq-warpstreamingformat] is such
   an interoperability point that defines the following:

   *  That the media format is LOC and with additional requirements such
      that audio and video can be time aligned (lip synched).

   *  A Catalog format to describe the tracks.

   *  That MOQT as defined in [I-D.ietf-moq-transport] is used for Media
      transmission.
